# Open Banking  API

Open Banking APIs play a vital role in transforming the financial services landscape by fostering innovation, empowering consumers, and promoting healthy competition. They create a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem that benefits individuals, businesses, and financial institutions alike.

## Scenario:
 A third-party financial app wants to access a user's account information from a bank securely. 

## Solution Design:
The API is designed using RESTful principles and utilises OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization.  The outcome will enable secure data exchange between banks and third-party financial Apps.

### Implementation steps :

#### API Endpoints and Authentication:

- The API will have endpoints to retrieve account information, transaction history, and other financial data.
For authentication, the third-party app must first register with the bank and obtain a **client ID** and **client secret**.
When a user authorizes the third-party app, the app exchanges the client ID and secret for an access token from the bank's OAuth server.

#### Authorization and Scopes:

- The API will define different scopes for various data access levels (e.g., "accounts:read", "transactions:read").
During the OAuth flow, the third-party app requests specific scopes based on the user's consent.

#### Access Token and Token Expiry:

An access token is included in the API requests' Authorization header, ensuring secure data transmission.
Access tokens will have a limited lifespan, and the API will provide a refresh token to obtain a new access token when it expires.

#### API Rate Limiting and Throttling:

Rate Limiting and throttling mechanisms will be implemented to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.


#### Error Handling and API Responses:

The API will provide meaningful error responses, including proper HTTP status codes and error messages.

#### Monitoring and Logging:

Monitoring and Logging will be set up to track API usage, performance, and potential issues.

### Data Encryption and Security:

All sensitive data transmitted between the third-party app and the API will be encrypted using HTTPS.
The API will implement strong security measures to protect against common attacks. Including:

- Broken Access control
- Cryptographic failure
- Insecure design
- SQL Injection Attacks
- DOS Attack
- DDOS Attack
- Authentication and Authorisation failures
- Cross Site Scripting
- Malware and Phishing.
